[P-Patch Community Gardens in Seattle WA](https://madiframpton.github.io/GEOG495_ppatch_gardens/)

P-patch community gardens are community operated open spaces, created for urban agriculture and gardening within Seattle. The namesake of the P-patch program belongs to the Picardo family, who operated a truck farm in the early 20th century  and provided produce for local markets. Part of the Picardo family farm was transformed into Seattle’s first community garden in 1973, and thus providing the foundation for Seattle’s current program. The first garden began during an economic downturn for Seattle - the famous Boeing Bust which came after the cancellation of a federally subsidized program (for a new airliner) which resulted in the termination of half of Boeing's workforce at the time. Increases in unemployment rates and food deserts (lack of accessibility to clean, healthy and affordable foods) along side a movement social activism and giving-back-to-the-land, sparked the drive for Darlyn Rundberg Del Boca (a UW student) to lobby the city of Seattle for funding to help transform this small section of the Picardo farm into a community space and program where children (from the nearby school) and their families could learn how to grow foods and vegetables for neighbors in need. Since this first community garden - community gardening has flourished. The drive to build local connections continues, there is no sight of a dwindling desire for urban agriculture.

As pictured above by the screenshot from my application, 89 community gardens span the city totaling 33.7 acres of public land - which can be plotted, harvested and cultivated by members of local communities. Each community garden space varies in size, number of plots, wait times, and features - but all are dedicated to strengthening community bonds and enriching the city's drive towards sustainable growth and urban agriculture. 

The purpose of the application is to showcase the 89 community garden spaces in and around Seattle, and provide the user with a url (to be compied and pasted into their browser) where they may learn more information about the garden, the availability, and how to sign up for a plot. The application's main function is to demonstrate the sprawl of community gardens in Seattle. Urban gardening is on the rise and spaces in these P-Patch gardens are starting to become high demand. This application thus allows to user to browse the location of each garden and learn if it is the right space for them. Below is a screenshotof the type of information displayed for each P-Patch Community Garden.
