# P-Patch Community Gardens - Locator
## Map Application:
[P-Patch Community Gardens in Seattle WA](https://madiframpton.github.io/GEOG495_ppatch_gardens/)


## Project Description/Functions: 
The purpose of my application is to showcase the community garden spaces in and around Seattle known as P-patches. My application provides the user with a tool that can help pinpoint the closest community garden to their provided location, and a url (to be copied and pasted into their browser) where they may learn more information about the garden, the availability, and how to sign up for a plot. Urban gardening is on the rise and spaces in these P-Patch gardens are starting to become high demand. This application allows to user to browse the location of each garden, and learn if it is the right space for them.

Below is a screenshot of the type of information displayed for each P-Patch Community Garden. The user can enter their address in the search bar, and the nearest P-Patch Garden's information will display along with a point on the location that was typed into the search bar. To simply browse various P-Patch gardens throughout Seattle, the user can either scroll through the list of community gardens in the sidebar, or click on the dots on the map to display the pop-up informational window unique to each P-Patch.

## A Brief History : 
P-patch community gardens are community operated open spaces, created to encourage urban agriculture and gardening within Seattle. The "P" in "P-patch" belongs to the Picardo family, who operated a truck farm in the early 20th century and provided produce for local markets. Part of the Picardo family farm was transformed into Seattle’s first community garden in 1973, thus providing the foundation for Seattle’s current program.

The first community garden was created during an economic downturn for Seattle prompted by the “Boeing Bust”. The “Boeing Bust” came after the cancellation of a federally subsidized program for a new airliner - the "Supersonic Transport", and resulted in the termination of roughly half of Boeing's workforce at that time. Increases in unemployment rates and an absence of clean, healthy and affordable foods, came along-side a wave of social activism and a nationwide back-to-earth movement. Darlyn Rundberg Del Boca, a UW student at the time, was inspired by the social change and wanted to open a community garden in Wedgewood Seattle in response to the community's need for fresh foods. Darlyn wanted to create a space that could educate children and families on how to grow their own foods - while also giving back to neighbors in need during this difficult time. Through Darlyn’s work, a small section of the Picardo farm was transformed. Her program recruited students and families from nearby schools to come and plant small crops, both for themselves and the surrounding community. The program proved to be a huge success and by the end of 1974, the city of Seattle authorized the creation of 10 new community gardens.

As pictured above by the screenshot from my application, 89 community gardens now span the city totaling 33.7 acres of public land - which can be plotted and harvested by anyone. Each garden space varies in size, number of plots, wait times, and features such as picnic areas, benches, raised beds, etc. They are also reflective of the neighborhoods in which they are located, based on the gardening styles and types of foods grown. Every p-patch is unique from the next, however all of these community gardens share a clear dedication to strengthening community bonds and enriching the city's drive towards sustainable growth and urban agriculture in the future. Community gardens have grown tremendously since the first P-Patch in the 1970s, and will continue to become more and more popular - as trends have already shown.
